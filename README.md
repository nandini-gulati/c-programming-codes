# 💻 First Year C Programming Practice Codes

This repository contains a collection of C programs I practiced during my first year of B.Tech at **UPES**. These beginner-friendly programs helped me understand key programming concepts in C — from basic syntax to logic-building problems using loops, conditions, and switch cases.
